# 🎒 Installation

## Option 1: Via Curseforge (Recommended)

This is the simplest and official method.

1. Open the [CurseForge Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/ubingo) site.
2. In the top-right corner click the orange <mark style="color:blue;background-color:orange;">Install</mark> Button.&#x20;
3. If you have the CurseForge Launcher already installed then click in the pop-up _Yes, open CurseForge app_ else if you don't have the launcher then click on _No, I need Curseforge._
4. So If you already have it then the CurseForge Launcher should now start and install the modpack but if you dont download Curseforge from the opened site from step 3 or click [here](https://download.curseforge.com) when you installed it then head over to step 1 again.&#x20;

## Option 2: via GDLauncher

This is for more _advanced_ users. But I will explain this here in an extra option because this is my at least my favourite launcher.

1. Download the GDLauncher from ther [website](https://gdevs.io).
2. After Installation follow the installation (I'd recommend the _Automatic Setup_) and add your Minecraft account.
3. Click on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">+</mark> in the buttom-left corner.
4. Select Curseforge and Search **uBingo**.
5. Hover over it and click on Download Latest and follow the setup.

## Option 3: via any other Launcher

We _(Unately)_ do **NOT** support any other Launcher than the both aprove. We only can say this:

* You can always download the latest modpack zip file **(in curseforge format)** from our [GitHub](https://github.com/Unately/uBingo/releases/latest).
* If you have any questions related to this don't ask any team member (you will get ignored). You could ask in the community help channel in our Discord Server or in the Off-Topic Category of our GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/Unately/uBingo/discussions/categories/off-topic).
